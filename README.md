## Project Description
This project is a **Personal Task Manager mobile application** developed using the **Flutter framework**.  
The application enables users to create, view, complete, and delete personal tasks in a simple and user-friendly manner.

In line with the course requirements, the application was developed **without any backend service, database, or local storage**. All task data exists **only during application runtime**.

---

## Aim of the Project
The aim of this project is to demonstrate practical understanding of:
- Mobile application development using Flutter
- User interface design with core Flutter widgets
- Screen navigation using the Navigator class
- State management using `StatefulWidget` and `setState()`

---

## Application Features
- Splash screen displayed on application launch
- Home screen showing a list of tasks
- Add task functionality with input validation
- Task details view
- Mark task as completed
- Delete task with confirmation dialog
- Snackbar notifications for user actions

---

## Application Screens
The application consists of the following screens:
1. Splash Screen  
2. Home Screen (Task List)

## State Management and Navigation
The application uses Flutter’s built-in state management approach with `StatefulWidget` and `setState()` to manage task data.  
Navigation between screens is handled using the `Navigator` class.

---

## Compliance with Assignment Requirements
- No backend service used
- No database or local storage used
- Core Flutter widgets implemented
- Proper navigation between screens
- Input validation and user feedback implemented

---

## Limitations
- Tasks are not saved permanently
- All data is cleared when the application is closed
- No authentication functionality implemented

---

## Conclusion
This project satisfies all the requirements of the Mobile Engineering assignment.  
It demonstrates the fundamental concepts of Flutter mobile application development, including user interface design, navigation, and state management, without reliance on external services.
